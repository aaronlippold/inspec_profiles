# InSpec Profiles Maintained by the SIMP Project

The [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) profiles present in this repository are being developed and
maintained as part of the SIMP project.

That said, it is our goal to make them valid for general purpose usage and
hopefully hand them off to a more structured body as time progresses.

Presently, this repository is being built as a monolithic repo but the
structure may change over time to better reflect our acceptance test
methodology.
